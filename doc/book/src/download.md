## Package Managers

Many popular Linux and BSD distributions provide an `oidentd` package that can
be installed with the package manager.
On distributions that package the latest version of oidentd, this is normally
the recommended approach.
Beware that some distributions ship severely outdated versions.

## Releases

[Releases can be downloaded from files.janikrabe.com][releases].
For oidentd, these are source releases (not compiled executables).
See the `INSTALL` file for instructions on how to compile and install oidentd.
